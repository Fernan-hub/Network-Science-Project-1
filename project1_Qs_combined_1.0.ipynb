Moreover, the latter reaches the highest nodes' degrees and there is a degree after which the proportions drop to values close to zero.

    "* Your group should submit both a completed Jupyter notebook and a pdf version of the notebook (generated using File --- Download as). If you cannot generate a pdf, try installing latex first. Each group should make a single submission.\n",
    "    To submit your assignment, go to the **Assesments and Mark Schemes** folder on the module Blackboard page. In the folder there is another folder called **Coursework 1 Drop Box Spring 24** within this folder there are two dropbox's one for the pdf and one for a ZIP file which should include your ipynb file. To convert a file to ZIP, right click on the file and click \"compress\" and this will generate a ZIP. (these should be named *project1_groupx.ipynb* and *project1_groupx.pdf* where x is your group number.\n",
    "*Please make sure all CID numbers are written at the top of the project.\n",
    "* You may use numpy, scipy, and matplotlib as needed. You may use networkx as needed. Please do not use any other packages without explicit permission.\n",
    "* Marking will be based on the correctness of your work, the efficiency of your codes, and the degree to which your submission reflects a good understanding of the material covered up to the release of this assignment. \n",
    "* This assignment requires sensible time-management on your part. Do not spend so much time on this assignment that it interferes substantially with your other modules. If you are concerned that your approach to the assignment may require an excessive amount of time, please get in touch with the instructor. \n",
    "* Questions about the assignment should be asked in private settings. This can be a \"private\" question on Ed (which is distinct from \"anonymous\"), asking for a one-on-one meeting during office hours, or during a problem class.\n",
    "* Please regularly backup your work. For example, you could keep an updated copy of your notebook on OneDrive.\n",
    "* In order to assign partial credit, we need to understand what your code is doing, so please add comments to the code to help us.\n",
    "* It may be helpful to initally develop your code in a Python module (outside of a function) and run it in a qtconsole (or similar Python terminal) so that you can readily access the values of the variables you are using.\n",
    "* Feel free to use/modify codes that I have provided during the term.\n"
